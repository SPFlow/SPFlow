  # We do not want to waste too many resources on testing all combinations. Thus we test:
  # - on the oldest and the two most recent version of Python that we support (see README.md)
  # - with the oldest version of the backend we support plus the two most recent major ones
  #   (to catch if only the newest version breaks something)
  # - A single test on Windows and macOS to catch if something breaks there
  # - We only test on the most recent version of macOS and Windows to save resources
  # - We test even fewer combinations for TensorFlow and Jax to save resources
